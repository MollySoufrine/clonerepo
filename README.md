# clonerepo
cloning a repository to computer and pushing it back onto github.

This file was created inorder to become more familiar with HTMl and CSS as well as pushing a file onto github. In this class activity we were instructed to create an html first and then style it a certain way after. It took me a while and I had to finish it after class was over.
I did follow an instructional video posted to help as well but I am open and appreciative of any feed back. If you open this file you may see the paragraph I had written and the contact info overlap. I tried to adjust the width on each of their ID's, #contact-info and #bio-info, however that did not seem to solve the problem.
I also tried to adjust the margin on the contain class, however that did nothing as well. I would love some suggestions on how to solve this issue or any added changes.
