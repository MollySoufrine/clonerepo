                <p>The photo above is my favorite activity to do. This is one of the best olympic weightlifters Jenny Arthur. I compete in olympic weightlifting and spend a lot of time training with my team. However during this time
                    I am forced to lift alone. I am very thankful I am still able to workout though because it is one of the things keeping me sane.
